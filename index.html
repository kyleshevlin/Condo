        I'm a big fan of <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">Susy</a>. It's an incredibly robust grid library. I've used it in dozens of projects and even wrote a <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Susy%202%20Snippets">snippets package for Sublime Text</a> for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in most of my Susy projects, I only need about 10% of what the library has to offer and the other 90% is wasted. Sitting there. Taking up space.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to make a grid library that was pared down. Where 100% of it was used, and covered almost all my use cases. In pursuit of that goal, I built <a href="https://github.com/kyleshevlin/condo">Condo</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like Susy, Condo is a Sass grid library designed to apply grid settings via the presentation layer of your website, i.e. in the CSS, and not in the semantic layer, i.e. your HTML. This is accomplished through a collection of mixins and functions. It differs from Susy in some important ways:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>It only handles a limited set of use cases.</li>
        <li>It only has the bare essential mixins and functions.</li>
        <li>And these mixins and functions are much more strict.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In Susy, many of the mixins and functions allow you to pass a list of values and keywords in as arguments. Condo is much more rigid, each mixin and function expecting a set of parameters with solid defaults, thus eliminating some of the cognitive load of wrapping your head around Susy's powerful capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to get to know Condo is to read the documentation and use it. You can read the full documentation <a href="docs">here</a>. The docs are automatically generated by Sassdoc from comments in the <a href="https://github.com/kyleshevlin/condo">source code</a>. I encourage you to look at the source code itself for a better understanding of how it all functions.
